            <h2>Challenges & Contests</h2>
            <p> If you want to revive the motivation in your members, holding a challenge or contest can get your
                members revved up in no time. A friendly, motivating challenge is a great way to build a sense of
                community leading to increased memberships. As long as the challenges are fair and offer a reward, it
                won’t require much effort to get your members involved?</p>

            <h2>Eating Events</h2>
            <p>Who wouldn’t want to try tasty food, especially when it’s free and healthy? An ideal way to get your
                members informed about your new product launches is to hold an eating event. No one would say no to a
                mouth-watering smoothie, some healthy snacks and other menus that guarantee fitness. With members
                rolling in through your gym door in an eating event, all you need to do is gently push them to share
                their experience online and spread the word.</p>

        <div id="eventbox3" class="eventbox">
            <h2> Social Gatherings</h2>
            <p>It’s time to bond with your members beyond the walls of your gym center. Consider inviting yourmembers to
                a dinner after a rigorous Tabata session or entertain them with a non-alcoholic night out. The idea is
                to strengthen your social bonds on a personal level so that your members view you more than a mere
                mentor. This type of bonding type would want your clients to stay with you for long. A welcoming open
                culture is bound to get your soaring membership rate</p>
